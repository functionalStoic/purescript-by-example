# Chapter 1

## Authors view of JS disadvantages:

- verbose
- untyped
- lacks powerful forms of abstraction
- Unrestricted JS code makes equational reasoning very difficult.

## Authors PureScript view of how it aims to address these issues

- features lightweight syntax, which allows us to write very expressive code
  which is still clear and readable
- uses a rich type system to support powerful abstractions.
- generates fast, understandable code, which is important when interoperating
  with JavaScript, or other languages which compile to JavaScript.

Goal is to convince that PureScript strikes a very practical balance between
the theoretical power of purely functional programming, and the fast-and-loose
programming style of JavaScript.

## Types and Type Inference

PureScript is a Statically Typed Language
